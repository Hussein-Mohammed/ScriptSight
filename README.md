# ScriptSight
ScriptSight is a software tool that can be used to explore and sort collections of document-page images using their AI-generated ‘computational visual catalogues’. Multiple visual attributes, such as text orientation, used writing implements (pencil versus ink), and text colour, can be filtered concurrently to isolate pages matching the specified criteria. Matching pages can be previewed as thumbnails with optional overlays indicating detected text regions, and and saved as organised, date-stamped folders for review or further processing.

This repository contains the source code of ScriptSight: https://www.fdr.uni-hamburg.de/record/17616, and the structure description of used JSON files.
